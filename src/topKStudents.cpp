/*
OVERVIEW:  You are given scores for students of a class in alphabetical order. Write a function that returns the names and scores of top K students.
Input is array of structures of type student (each student has name and score).
E.g.: If input is [ { "stud1", 20 }, { "stud2", 30 }, { "stud3", 40 } ] (three students with marks 20, 30 , 40) and K value is 2.
return top 2 students [ { "stud2", 30 }, { "stud3", 40 } ]

INPUTS: array of structures of type student, length of the array, integer K.

OUTPUT: Return top K students from array. Output need not be in decreasing order of scores.

ERROR CASES: Return NULL for invalid inputs.
